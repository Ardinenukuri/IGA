## Problem Background

Burundi is one of the developing countries in the world; many families cannot afford to send their children to school, especially girls. Cultural beliefs often dictate that girls should prioritize household chores, impeding their access to formal education, etc. Consequently, the gender gap in education in Burundi is significant. According to UNICEF, the net enrollment rate for girls in primary school is 77%, compared to 87% for boys. The gap is even wider at the secondary level, where the net enrollment rate for girls is 48%, compared to 65% for boys because in some cultures, girls are not seen as needing as much education as boys, and also when it comes to many families who may not be able to afford school fees, they prefer to send boys only.

## Our Proposed Solution

To address the issue, we have developed a web app called IGA. This app serves as a Learning hub where some women who have overcome these challenges and achieved success in life could support those who are less fortunate, by sharing some of their resources and knowledge, either online or in person, and by telling their stories on IGA. The users will do that by posting blogs and photos on the website.
